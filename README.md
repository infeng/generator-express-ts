> Yeoman generator for creating an application using Express and TypeScript.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-express-ts using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we'll assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo typescript typings
npm install -g generator-express-ts
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo express-ts
```

After generating your project, cd into it, install TypeScript definitions and compile TypeScript files into JavaScript files:
```
typings install
```
```
tsc
```

After everything is finished, run your project:
```
node app/bin/www.js --harmony
```
